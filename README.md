# Colour-Detection
Colour detection code built using OpenCV Python used in a 6 D.O.F robot for picking up different coloured objects from a conveyor belt.

What I learnt:
1.Thresholding and masking. 
2.Various formats of representing colour spaces.

Future improvements:
1.Looking to implement colour constancy under different lighting conditions using contrastive learning approaches.
